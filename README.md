# House Price Predict

The goal is to understand the relationship between house features and how these
variables affect the house price.
Using more than one model, predict the price of the house using the given dataset. Please compare the
accuracy of the models along with the drawbacks of each technique's assumptions before recommending
the final prediction model.

#Approach

Used Multiple Baseline models and checked their error and accuracy by suggesting best models for further usage.
Explained the drawbacks of the underperforming models.

# Product Matching

Using ML/DL techniques, match similar products from the Flipkart dataset with the Amazon dataset. Once
similar products are matched, display the retail price from FK and AMZ side by side. Please explore as
many techniques as possible before choosing the final technique.
You may either display the final result in single table format OR You may create a simple form where we
input the product name and the output of prices of the product from both websites are displayed.

#Approach

Cleaning and merged two datasets and created a small modlue where siimilar items were displayed side by side with their price details, and final fomred is being saved in the csv format as per required problem statement.
